# tool-installer-lite
This script will attempt to install the tools most used by members of FITsec. This does the basics and will not add a new repository in the process.

## How to install
You can get the tools from any debian based system by simply cloning the repository, then running this command line in the repo.

```bash
bash get-tools.sh
```
